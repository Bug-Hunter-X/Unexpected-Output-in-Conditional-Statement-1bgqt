This repository contains a MATLAB function with a logical error in its conditional statements. The function `myFunction` is intended to calculate different results based on the input value `x`. However, due to a flaw in the conditional logic, it produces unexpected results for negative input values. The bug and its solution are demonstrated with code samples and explanations in the respective `.m` files.
